          Our Work in North West and North Central Nigeria
        </ui-text>
        <ui-text class="paragraph">
          We have actively worked with women, girls, and children affected by gender-based violence (GBV) in various communities within the Northwest and North Central zones of Nigeria, particularly in Kebbi State. We have supported GBV survivors in vulnerable communities such as Usher in Zuru Local Government, Gulumbe in Birnin Kebbi Local Government area, Kola Area and Ugwar Zabarmawa. Just to mention a few
        </ui-text>

        <ui-text type="subtitle">Our Interventions</ui-text>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Awareness Campaigns:</strong> We spearheaded GBV awareness programs to educate local women and girls about their rights, safety measures, and available support systems. We worked closely with local leaders and community influencers to foster a more supportive environment for survivors.</li>
          <li><strong>Survivor Support Services:</strong> We provided immediate support and assistance to survivors of GBV, including counseling services, legal advice, and referrals to appropriate healthcare facilities. We facilitated access to psychosocial support to help survivors recover emotionally and mentally from their traumatic experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>Capacity Building and Empowerment:</strong> We conducted workshops and training for women and girls on economic empowerment and self-sustainability to reduce vulnerability to gender-based violence. These initiatives aimed to give women the tools they need to gain financial independence and reduce dependence on abusive partners or households.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaboration with Local Authorities:</strong> We engaged with law enforcement, healthcare providers, and traditional institutions to ensure that GBV cases are properly handled, victims receive justice, and perpetrators are held accountable. We worked closely with police units and healthcare professionals to establish safe reporting channels and provide swift responses to GBV incidents.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Advocacy:</strong> We promoted social change by engaging community members in dialogues around the harmful effects of gender-based violence. These conversations were designed to challenge cultural norms and practices that perpetuate violence against women and girls.</li>
        </ul>

        <ui-text class="paragraph mt-7">
          Through this work, we have seen firsthand the resilience of women and girls in these communities. We are dedicated to continuing efforts that help build a future where they are safe, empowered, and free from violence.
